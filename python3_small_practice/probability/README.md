### Red and Green Chips problem

  Idea to simulate this problem came from Mike Lawler's tweet: https://twitter.com/mikeandallie/status/1296438813431148544

#### Problem description:

  ```
  A box contains 3 red chips and 2 green chips. Chips are drawn randomly, 
  one at a time without replacement, until all 3 of the reds are drawn or 
  until both green chips are drawn. What is the probability that the 3 
  reds are drawn?

  (A) 3/10  (B) 2/5  (C) 1/2  (D) 3/5  (E) 7/10
  ```
