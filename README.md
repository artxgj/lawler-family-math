## Python Adaptation of Mike Lawler's FamilyMath's Mathematica Code

I first came across [Mike Lawler's Math Page](https://mikesmathpage.wordpress.com) after seeing Nassim Nicholas Taleb retweeted Mike's Lawler blog on [Explaining some statistical ideas from Nassim Taleb to kids](https://mikesmathpage.wordpress.com/2019/08/25/explaining-some-statistical-ideas-from-nassim-taleb-to-kids/).

Since then, I have been following Mike's Math Page. He recently started working on probability problems with his kids. They are going through Frederick Mosteller's "Fifty Challenging Problems In Probability".

Mike Lawler often uses Mathematica to illuminate the math topics he and his kids tackle. I figure it would be educational and fun for me to convert some of his Mathematica code to Python.
