## Philippine Hokkien and Minnan Synonyms of Mandarin Words

[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/咱人話) has a list of dialectal synonyms of Chinese words in Mandarin 普通話. I think it is more precise to call them [topolectal](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/topolect) synonyms.
The words on this page were programmatically-generated from Wiktionary's synonyms data. These synoynyms belong to the subset of Philippine Hokkien **咱人話** and Minnan **閩南** (Quanzhou and Xiamen) variants. The romanized characters next to the Hokkien synonyms on this page are
called [Pe̍h-ōe-jī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe̍h-ōe-jī).
