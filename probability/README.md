## Probability Study

This probability section began as a series of exercises to convert some of Mike Lawler's Family Math Mathematica-simulations to Python.  

I first came across [Mike Lawler's Math Page](https://mikesmathpage.wordpress.com) after seeing Nassim Nicholas Taleb retweet of Mike's Lawler blog on [Explaining some statistical ideas from Nassim Taleb to kids](https://mikesmathpage.wordpress.com/2019/08/25/explaining-some-statistical-ideas-from-nassim-taleb-to-kids/).

Since learning how to do simple Python-simulations from Mike Lawler's math lessons, I started to write simulations on my own whenever I learn something about probability that motivates me to write code.
